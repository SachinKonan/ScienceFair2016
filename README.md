# ScienceFair2016

This year's Science Fair Project consists of a low-cost Doppler radar system that can detect the presence of victims buried under rubble after earthquake. A cheap, $5 radar called the HB-100 was utilized, but circuitry had to be developed to filter and amplify the output signal (schematic finals can be found in FinalFiles/Schematic with LT Spice Tests). From there Least Squares Smoothing, Sliding Hanning Windows, and a MUSIC Algorithm were used to process and identify the hearbeat and respiration signals present in the output waveform.
